Thank you for downloading COD for XOOPS 2.0.14+

This theme is inspired by the Call of Duty2 FPS game.

This theme was originally a nuke theme, by http://www.sddesign.biz/

I have ported it over to XOOPS.

Enjoy.

A big thanks to http://www.sddesign.biz/ for all the hard work on this and many other great themes for Nuke.
